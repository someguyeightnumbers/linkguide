# How to Get Links

**[VERY IMPORTANT] If you're a zionist, racist, homophobe, transphobe or bigot burn in hell and fuck off this isn't for you.**

## What is Torrenting?

A torrent file is a way of sharing digital media peer to peer. There's usually a **seeder** (someone who has the file and is uploading it) and a **leacher** (that’s you, trying to download the file). The size of files and movies and their download speeds vary, but usually, we look for torrents from **good sources with lots of seeders**. You are encouraged to **seed whatever you leach** to keep the cycle going.

To download media (film, TV, music, and sometimes books), the easiest way is torrent files. This is **torrenting**.

## To Get Started Torrenting

You need:

1. A **torrent client**
2. A **torrent file**
3. A **VPN**

Let's break them down:

### 1. Torrent Client

The program that will download the torrent for you. You can Google _best torrent client 2025_ or check a reference like:

- [Best Torrent Clients 2025 – TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/best/torrent-client)

### 2. Torrent File

You’ll need somewhere like a search engine or archive for torrents. We’ll discuss this in depth in the **Torrent Sites** section.

### 3. VPN

Please be careful and vigilant. Get a VPN.

> I'm currently using [**Proton VPN**](https://protonvpn.com), but this isn't a recommendation for it. Research a good one. Ask a friend who uses a VPN. Find one that works for you.  
> ⚠️ If you live in a country where piracy is a crime or a federal crime, **please be very careful.**

**[IMPORTANT]** Use an **adblocker**:
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/ar/firefox/new/) with [**uBlock Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com/)
- [**AdGuard**](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) (VPN that blocks ads — _I pay for AdGuard and I’m very happy with it_)

## Torrent Sites

**[IMPORTANT]** Read this first:  
[Reddit Piracy Wiki Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/)

This will be your source for files, which you can download using your client. You can either:

- Download the `.torrent` file and open it, revealing its contents in your client.
- Click a **magnet link**, which opens directly in your client.

Check that the source you're getting files from is **reputable and not sketchy**.

Torrent sites often change domains or get taken down. Here’s how to find new ones:

1. [Top Torrent Sites – TorrentFreak](https://torrentfreak.com/top-torrent-sites/)
2. Google _torrent sites reddit 2025_ and check recent posts with upvotes.
3. Big sites like **YTS** and **The Pirate Bay** — search their **Wikipedia page** and check the **info box** for the latest domain.

There are also **torrent search engines**. Try typing into your URL bar (with VPN enabled):  
**e x t . t o** (without spaces).

### Notes

- Be vigilant — if the torrent looks sketchy, be careful.  
  *Tip: Ask a nerdy friend for a quick crash course.*
- Check the **number of seeders**. If it's low and the file is large, it’ll download slowly.  
  If you download the file, **please seed it** for a good while.

Torrent sites are good for:

- Movies
- TV Shows
- Software
- Games (⚠️ but be very careful)

### To Play Video Files

Use a video player like:

- [**VLC**](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
- [**MPC**](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm)

Google them and find their official site.

### For Subtitles

- [OpenSubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/)
- [Reddit Subtitle Guide – r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jrbqkt/favorite_site_to_get_srt_subtitle_files/)

Subtitles are usually in `.srt` or `.ass` format.

## Books and Scientific Papers

There used to be two huge sites:

- **Z-Library**
- **Library Genesis**

These are **shadow libraries** that hosted nearly all human knowledge. To find their current domains (they change due to legal pressure):

1. Google the name.
2. Go to **Wikipedia**.
3. Find the **info box** with the active domain.

### For Scientific Papers

- **Sci-Hub** – Same steps: Google it, go to Wikipedia, find the domain.

### For Everything

- **Anna’s Archive** – Great search engine for all shadow libraries.

> Most shadow libraries let you download without torrenting.

If you need more guides:  
[Ultimate Book Piracy Guide – r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1kg8fj0/ultimate_book_piracy_guide/)

Most books are in:

- `.pdf`
- `.epub`

Google how to open these formats if needed.

## Other Options

There are **private trackers** and forums that share links and torrents. They're often **not free to sign up** for and aren’t linked here to avoid legal scrapers.

To learn about them:  
[Open Signups – r/OpenSignups](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSignups/)

There are also some **Twitter accounts** that share links. Here are some usernames:

- `drivelexandria`
- `allindrive`
- `lesenfants17811`
